# Cosmjs - Offline Example

In this repository we demonstrate the use of cosmjs for offline signing.
The entire process is heavily commented in `index.ts`. One needs
to manually add a mnemonic to the source code.

## Getting started

You need yarn and typescript. Run

```shell
yarn install
```
to install all required dependencies. After that run

```shell
yarn build && yarn start
```

to execute the example configuration.

## Explorers and Endpoints

This script uses the official KYVE testnet `Kaon`.
